Stride is an application that utilizes a GraphQL API for users to create, update, and remove workouts. The front end was built with React and the MUI component library. The backend was built using Mongo Atlas for the Database and Express/Node to run the server. Apollo server was used to connect the api to the front-end to be able to query and mutate data. JWT were used for user creation and authentication.
